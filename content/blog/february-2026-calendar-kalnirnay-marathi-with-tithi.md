The Kalnirnay calendar is a widely respected and followed almanac in Maharashtra and among Marathi-speaking communities worldwide. It serves as a comprehensive guide for daily life, incorporating religious, cultural, and astrological information. Unlike a standard Gregorian calendar, the Kalnirnay provides details on *tithis*, *nakshatras* (constellations), festivals, auspicious days, and timings for various activities.

The Marathi calendar, or *panchang*, is based on the lunar cycle, with each month beginning on the day after the new moon (Amavasya) or full moon (Pournima), depending on the specific tradition being followed. February 2026 holds specific importance as it bridges the winter and spring seasons, encompassing significant cultural and religious events.

**Detailed Kalnirnay:** This version provides in-depth information on all aspects of the calendar, including tithis, nakshatras, festivals, auspicious timings, and astrological predictions. It is ideal for those who require a comprehensive guide for religious and cultural observances.
