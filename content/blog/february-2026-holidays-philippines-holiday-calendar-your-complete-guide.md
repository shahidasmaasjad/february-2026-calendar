A holiday calendar in the Philippines is more than just a list of dates; it’s a framework that influences business operations, academic schedules, and personal planning. The official list of holidays is determined by the Office of the President through formal proclamations, typically issued the year prior. These proclamations categorize holidays, which in turn dictates workforce compensation and obligations.

Understanding this calendar is crucial for everyone, from employees and employers to students and travelers. It helps in anticipating high-traffic travel seasons, scheduling important events without conflict, and ensuring compliance with labor laws regarding holiday pay. The key difference from other calendars is its legal basis, which directly impacts daily life and commerce across the nation.

The primary distinction to understand is between *Regular Holidays* and *Special (Non-Working) Days*. Regular holidays are dates with major national significance, and employees who work on these days are entitled to 200% of their basic pay. Special (non-working) days, on the other hand, typically have more flexible pay rules, often granting an additional 30% of the basic wage for employees who are required to work. February 2026 features prominent special non-working days.

The Philippine holiday calendar for February 2026 is marked by two significant national events. These dates are officially recognized and will affect operations for schools, government offices, and many private businesses. It’s important to note their specific classifications to understand their full impact.

### Chinese New Year: February 17, 2026

Falling on a **Tuesday**, the Chinese New Year is one of the most important cultural celebrations in the Philippines, reflecting the deep-rooted influence of the Filipino-Chinese community. It is officially declared a *Special (Non-Working) Day* to allow the nation to partake in the festivities. This holiday is based on the lunisolar calendar, so its date on the Gregorian calendar changes annually.

### EDSA People Power Revolution Anniversary: February 25, 2026

Commemorating the historic 1986 revolution that restored democracy in the Philippines, this day is observed nationwide. Falling on a **Wednesday**, February 25th is also designated as a *Special (Non-Working) Day*. It serves as a day of remembrance and is particularly significant in the nation’s capital region where most of the historical events unfolded.

### Valentine’s Day: February 14, 2026

While not an official public holiday, Valentine’s Day (a Saturday in 2026) is a widely celebrated observance. It does not involve the suspension of work or classes but has a significant commercial and cultural impact. Restaurants, hotels, and retail stores often see a surge in activity, making it a key date for many businesses.

The list of Philippine holidays is dynamic and subject to change based on presidential proclamations. While the dates for fixed holidays like the EDSA Anniversary remain constant, the declaration of other holidays, especially those based on different calendars like the Chinese New Year, shifts annually. For 2026, February is confirmed to host these two major special non-working days.

Furthermore, some holidays are location-specific. While there are no widely observed provincial or city-level holidays in February, it’s always wise for residents to check with their local government units (LGUs) for any specific proclamations that might affect their locality, such as foundation day anniversaries.

The context of the year is vital. In 2026, both major holidays in February fall in the middle of the week (Tuesday and Wednesday). This placement means there are no automatic long weekends connected to these dates. Any potential long weekend would require taking personal leave on the adjacent days or a separate proclamation creating a bridge holiday, which is not standard practice.

Let’s break down the key elements of the February 2026 calendar for practical planning.

* **February 14 (Saturday):** Valentine’s Day (Observance)
* **February 17 (Tuesday):** Chinese New Year (Special Non-Working Day)
* **February 25 (Wednesday):** EDSA People Power Revolution Anniversary (Special Non-Working Day)

Understanding these components is essential for both personal and professional planning. For employees, it means knowing your rights regarding holiday pay. For employers, it’s about ensuring accurate payroll processing and managing workforce schedules effectively.

The February 2026 holiday calendar has numerous practical applications across different aspects of life.

**Personal Use:** Individuals can use these dates to schedule appointments, plan short local trips, or organize family gatherings. Knowing that February 17th and 25th are non-working days allows for advanced planning, even without a long weekend.

**Professional and Business Use:** HR and payroll departments rely on this calendar for accurate salary computations. Operations managers use it to plan staffing levels, while marketing teams can launch campaigns centered around events like Chinese New Year and Valentine’s Day.

**Educational Use:** Schools and universities incorporate these holidays into their academic calendars. Classes at all levels, from preschool to postgraduate studies, are typically suspended on special non-working days, allowing students and faculty a break.

**Travel and Tourism:** While February 2026 doesn’t feature long weekends, travel agencies and hotels can still anticipate shifts in demand around the holiday dates. Tourists, both local and international, can use this information to understand when attractions or services might have different operating hours.

To make the most of the holiday calendar, it’s important to use it as a proactive planning tool rather than a reactive reference.

When planning your activities, always consider the type of holiday. A special non-working day has different implications for pay and business operations compared to a regular holiday. Always confirm with your employer about specific company policies regarding holiday work and compensation.

A common mistake is assuming that an observance like Valentine’s Day is a public holiday. This can lead to confusion when scheduling work or appointments. Always differentiate between official holidays (where work/classes are suspended) and popular observances.

Another pitfall is relying on outdated information. Holiday proclamations can sometimes be amended. The best practice is to always refer to the most current announcements from the *Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines* for the definitive list of holidays for the year.

For beginners in workforce management or personal scheduling, a great practice is to integrate these dates into a digital calendar (like Google Calendar or Outlook) early on. Set reminders and clearly label each holiday with its type (e.g., "Chinese New Year – Special Non-Working Day") to avoid confusion.
