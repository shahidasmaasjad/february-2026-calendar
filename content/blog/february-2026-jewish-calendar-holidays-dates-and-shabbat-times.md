The Jewish calendar, also known as the Hebrew calendar, is a lunisolar system, meaning its months are based on lunar cycles while its years are aligned with the solar cycle. This intricate system ensures that the timing of festivals remains consistent with the seasons prescribed in the Torah—for example, Passover always occurs in the spring. Each new Hebrew month begins with the appearance of the new moon, creating a rich connection between celestial events and religious observance.

Understanding the Jewish calendar is crucial for Jewish practice. It dictates the dates for all holidays, fast days, and celebrations. It is also used to determine the dates for bar and bat mitzvahs, the anniversaries of loved ones’ passing (yahrzeits), and the weekly reading of the Torah. Unlike the Gregorian calendar, which is purely solar, the Jewish calendar’s dual nature requires periodic adjustments, such as the addition of a leap month, to keep it synchronized with the seasons.

The most fundamental difference from the Gregorian calendar is the concept of a ‘day.’ In the Jewish tradition, a day begins at sunset and ends at the following sunset. This is why Shabbat and all holidays begin on the evening before the day listed on a standard secular calendar. For February 2026, this means any event noted for a specific date, such as a holiday, will commence on the preceding evening.

Jewish calendars are available in several formats, each serving a different purpose. The most traditional is the printed wall calendar, often found in Jewish homes, schools, and synagogues. These calendars typically feature beautiful Judaica art and provide all necessary information for the month at a glance, including Shabbat times for a specific city.

For those who prefer a modern approach, digital Jewish calendars are incredibly popular. These come in the form of smartphone apps or websites like Hebcal and Chabad.org. Their primary advantage is customization; they can calculate precise Shabbat and holiday times for your exact location and can be integrated with your personal digital calendar (like Google Calendar or Outlook) to provide automated reminders.

Pocket-sized printed calendars and diaries are also common, especially for individuals who prefer a non-digital method for personal planning. These are useful for jotting down appointments and notes while still keeping track of Hebrew dates and upcoming religious observances.

The year 2026 in the Gregorian calendar corresponds to the Hebrew year 5786. Significantly, **5786 is a Jewish leap year**. A leap year in the Hebrew calendar occurs seven times in a 19-year cycle and includes an additional month to ensure the calendar doesn’t drift out of alignment with the solar year. This extra month is known as Adar I (*Adar Rishon*), and the regular month of Adar becomes Adar II (*Adar Sheni*).

Consequently, February 2026 overlaps with the end of the Hebrew month of Shevat and the beginning of the first of two Adar months, **Adar I**. The presence of Adar I means that some observances are adjusted. For instance, the major festival of Purim, which is celebrated on the 14th of Adar, will take place in Adar II (in March 2026). However, a minor version of the holiday is marked in Adar I.

Another critical context is geography. All time-bound commandments in Judaism, especially the start and end of Shabbat and holidays, are determined by local astronomical events—specifically, sunset. Therefore, the times listed in any Jewish calendar must be adjusted for your specific location. Candle-lighting times for New York City will be vastly different from those in Jerusalem, London, or Los Angeles.

A key component of any Jewish monthly calendar is the listing of Hebrew and Gregorian dates side-by-side. For February 2026, the month begins on the 13th of Shevat and concludes on the 11th of Adar I.

**Shabbat** is the cornerstone of Jewish life, occurring every week from Friday sunset to Saturday nightfall. Each weekly entry on a Jewish calendar will include the name of the weekly Torah portion and the precise local time for candle-lighting (*Hadlakat Nerot*) on Friday evening, which marks the beginning of Shabbat. It will also list the time for *Havdalah*, the ceremony that concludes Shabbat on Saturday night.

Holidays and special days are prominently featured. In February 2026, there are a few notable dates to be aware of. While not a major festival, these days hold significance in the Jewish cycle.

The weekly Torah portion, or *Parashat HaShavua*, is another essential element. Each Shabbat, a specific section from the Torah is read aloud in the synagogue. The calendar will specify which portion is read each week, allowing individuals to study it in advance.

* **February 2: Tu BiShvat.** Occurring on the 15th of Shevat, this day is known as the “New Year for Trees.” It is often celebrated by eating fruits native to the Land of Israel and by planting trees.
* **February 7 (Shabbat Yitro):** The Torah portion *Yitro* is read, which famously includes the account of the giving of the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai.
* **February 14 (Shabbat Mishpatim):** The Torah portion *Mishpatim* is read. This section details a wide array of civil and religious laws.
* **February 18: Rosh Chodesh Adar I.** This marks the beginning of the new Hebrew month of Adar I. Special prayers are added to the liturgy.
* **February 21 (Shabbat Terumah):** The Torah portion *Terumah* is read, which describes the instructions for building the Mishkan (Tabernacle).
* **February 21-22: Purim Katan.** In a leap year, the 14th and 15th of Adar I are designated as *Purim Katan* (“Minor Purim”). While it lacks the formal observances of the main Purim (like reading the Megillah), it is marked with a sense of minor celebration and the omission of certain penitential prayers.
* **February 28 (Shabbat Tetzaveh):** The Torah portion *Tetzaveh* is read, focusing on the priestly garments and the eternal flame of the menorah.

On a personal level, the Jewish calendar is essential for observing life cycle events. A yahrzeit, the anniversary of a relative’s death, is observed according to the Hebrew date. Knowing the corresponding dates in February 2026 allows for proper planning to light a memorial candle and recite the Kaddish prayer.

For families, the calendar is a vital tool for planning. If a child’s bar or bat mitzvah is approaching, the family will use the calendar to identify the correct Torah portion for that week. It is also used to ensure that weddings and other celebrations do not conflict with Shabbat or festival dates.

Professionally and educationally, the calendar is indispensable. Jewish schools and community centers base their schedules around the holiday cycle. In the workplace, individuals use it to request time off for religious observance in advance, ensuring their professional responsibilities are managed around holy days.

As a planning tool, the February 2026 calendar allows for foresight. One can see when Rosh Chodesh occurs or note the approach of Purim in the following month (Adar II), enabling preparation for these special times.

When choosing a Jewish calendar tool, the first consideration is format. Do you prefer a physical calendar hanging in your kitchen, or does a digital app that sends you reminders fit your lifestyle better? Many people use a combination of both.

The most critical factor for accuracy is location. If you are using a digital tool or website, always ensure you have set your precise location (city and country). Using candle-lighting times for New York when you live in Chicago will result in incorrect observance times. Generic printed calendars often list times for several major cities, so be sure you are looking at the correct column.

A common mistake is forgetting that a Jewish day begins at sunset. If a holiday is listed as February 2, it actually begins at sundown on February 1. This is a crucial detail for all planning and observance.

For beginners, the best practice is to use a reliable and user-friendly source. Websites like Hebcal.com, Chabad.org, and MyZmanim.com are highly respected for their accuracy and provide customizable calendars, email reminders, and detailed explanations of holidays and practices.
