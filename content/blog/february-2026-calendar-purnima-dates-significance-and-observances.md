This article serves as a comprehensive guide to the Purnima in February 2026, detailing its exact dates, astrological significance, and the cultural practices associated with it. For those who follow the lunar calendar for spiritual practices or simply wish to understand this celestial phenomenon, this information is invaluable.

Purnima, derived from Sanskrit, literally means ‘full moon.’ It occurs once every lunar month when the Moon is fully illuminated by the Sun, appearing as a perfect disc in the night sky. In Hindu cosmology, each Purnima is not just an astronomical event but is imbued with unique spiritual energies and is often dedicated to specific deities or historical events.

The full moon day is widely considered auspicious for various religious activities, including fasting (vrat), performing pujas (worship), charitable acts (daan), and taking holy baths (snan) in sacred rivers. It is believed that spiritual endeavors undertaken on Purnima yield enhanced benefits.

While Purnima is a recurring monthly event, its significance shifts with the associated Hindu calendar month. For instance, the Purnima in Shravan month is Shravan Purnima, celebrated as Raksha Bandhan, while Kartik Purnima is celebrated with great fervor, often involving lamp offerings and holy dips.

The exact date and time of Purnima are determined by astronomical calculations based on the position of the Moon and Sun. These calculations can sometimes vary slightly depending on the panchang (Hindu calendar) followed in different regions, leading to minor differences in observance timings.

In *February 2026*, the Purnima Tithi (lunar day) is expected to fall on a specific date, which will be detailed further in this guide. It’s important to note that the Tithi can sometimes span across two Gregorian calendar days, meaning the start and end times are crucial for determining the exact observance period.

For the month of February 2026, the Purnima is known as **Magha Purnima**. This designation comes from its occurrence during the Hindu lunar month of Magha. Magha Purnima is particularly sacred, especially for devotees who observe the month-long Kalpavas fast on the banks of holy rivers like the Ganga.

Magha Purnima holds immense religious significance and is often associated with acts of charity, penance, and bathing in sacred waters. It is believed that taking a holy dip in the Ganges, Yamuna, or other sacred rivers on this day can cleanse sins and lead to liberation (moksha).

Historically, this day is also linked to various mythological stories and is considered an ideal time for spiritual purification and introspection. Many pilgrims gather at confluence points, such as the Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj, to perform rituals.

* **Holy Bath (Snan):** Devotees wake up early and take a sacred dip, particularly in rivers.
* **Fasting (Vrat):** Many observe a full or partial fast, consuming only fruits, milk, or specific grains.
* **Charity (Daan):** Giving away food, clothes, money, or other essentials to the needy is highly recommended.
* **Puja and Aarti:** Special prayers and offerings are made to deities, often Lord Vishnu.
* **Satyanarayan Katha:** Reciting the story of Lord Satyanarayan is a common practice on Purnima.

The calculation of Purnima Tithi can vary slightly based on the specific Panchang (Hindu calendar) being consulted. While the astronomical full moon is a precise moment, the Hindu calendar defines a ‘Tithi’ which is a lunar day, and it can begin or end at any time of day, not necessarily at sunrise or sunset.

Therefore, it is essential to consult a reliable local Drik Panchang or temple calendar to confirm the exact start and end times of the Purnima Tithi for your specific region. This ensures that fasts and rituals are observed during the most auspicious period.

The core elements of any Purnima observance typically revolve around purity, devotion, and selfless acts. While the specific deity or narrative might change, the underlying principles of seeking spiritual merit and divine blessings remain constant.

Understanding the Purnima in February 2026 is useful for several reasons. For devout Hindus, it provides the necessary information to plan their religious observances, fasts, and pilgrimages well in advance. It allows them to align their spiritual practices with the auspicious timings.

Beyond religious observance, knowing the lunar phases can be practical for those interested in astrology, natural cycles, or even gardening, as some traditions link lunar phases to various earthly activities. It also serves as a cultural reference point for understanding local festivals and traditions.

For individuals new to Hindu traditions or those living in different time zones, confirming the correct Purnima date and time is paramount. Local temple authorities or online reliable panchang resources are the best options for verifying these details.
