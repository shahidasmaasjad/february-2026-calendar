Saraswati Puja is a Hindu festival dedicated to the goddess Saraswati, who represents knowledge, music, arts, wisdom, and learning. It is celebrated across India and in various parts of the world where Hindus reside. The festival usually falls in late January or early February, depending on the Hindu lunar calendar. The observance of Saraswati Puja is deeply rooted in tradition and is considered an auspicious time for students and anyone involved in learning and the arts.

Saraswati Puja is more than just a religious event; it is a cultural phenomenon. Schools and educational institutions often hold special prayers and ceremonies. Students place their books, instruments, and art supplies before the goddess, seeking her blessings for success in their respective fields. The day is marked by colorful decorations, traditional music, and the sharing of sweets and festive meals.

The date of Saraswati Puja is determined by the Hindu lunar calendar, specifically the Vasant Panchami tithi. Vasant Panchami marks the beginning of spring and is considered an auspicious day to worship Saraswati. In February 2026, the precise date will need to be confirmed closer to the time, as it depends on astronomical calculations. Checking a reliable Hindu calendar or consulting with a knowledgeable priest will provide the exact date.

There are regional variations in how Saraswati Puja is celebrated. In some parts of India, it is a grand affair with elaborate pandals (temporary structures) and cultural programs. In others, it is a more intimate family affair with prayers and offerings at home. Despite these differences, the underlying theme of seeking knowledge and wisdom remains consistent.

The rituals performed during Saraswati Puja are symbolic and meaningful. The goddess is offered flowers, fruits, and sweets. Many devotees observe a fast on this day. Special prayers and hymns are recited, and educational activities are encouraged. It is a day to reflect on the importance of learning and to seek blessings for intellectual growth.

One of the key elements of Saraswati Puja is the veneration of educational materials. Books, pens, musical instruments, and art supplies are placed before the idol of Saraswati.

Saraswati Puja is widely celebrated in schools and colleges. Students and teachers come together to organize prayers, cultural programs, and competitions. It is a day of joyous celebration and a reminder of the value of education. Many institutions also organize special lectures and workshops to promote learning and intellectual development.
