Understanding the precise dates and timings is crucial because the lunar days (tithis) do not always align perfectly with the 24-hour solar day used in the Gregorian calendar. This article provides a detailed look at the Agiyaras observances falling in February 2026, explaining their importance, the rules of fasting, and how to interpret the Gujarati calendar correctly for these holy days.

We will explore the specific types of Ekadashi likely to occur during this month, the difference between the waxing and waning phases of the moon, and practical advice for observing these fasts in the modern world. Whether you are a strict observer or someone looking to start this spiritual practice, this guide covers all necessary aspects.

**Topic Overview: What is Agiyaras?**

Agiyaras is the Gujarati word for Ekadashi, the eleventh day of the lunar fortnight. In the Hindu calendar, there are two fortnights in a month: the bright half (Shukla Paksha or Sud) and the dark half (Krishna Paksha or Vad). Consequently, Agiyaras occurs twice a month. It is considered one of the most sacred days for fasting and prayer, believed to cleanse the soul and body of sins and impurities.

The observance is deeply rooted in Puranic history, where the day is personified as a goddess who emerged from Lord Vishnu to defeat the demon Mura. Devotees believe that observing a fast on this day pleases Lord Vishnu and grants spiritual merit (Punya). In the context of the Gujarati calendar, which follows the Amanta system (months ending on a no-moon day), these dates are pivotal for religious planning.

Unlike other festivals that may focus on celebration and feasting, Agiyaras is primarily about austerity, control over the senses, and devotion. It serves as a bi-monthly reset for the digestive system and the mind, allowing devotees to detach from material concerns and focus on the divine.

**Main Variations and Types of Agiyaras**

While every eleventh day is an Agiyaras, each one has a unique name and specific significance depending on the month it falls in. In February 2026, the dates will correspond to the Hindu months of Magha and Phalguna. The two primary variations encountered are Jaya Ekadashi and Vijaya Ekadashi.

**Jaya Ekadashi** typically falls during the Shukla Paksha (Sud) of the month of Magha. It is believed that observing this fast absolves one of sins committed in past lives and liberates the soul from lower forms of existence. It is a day of joy and spiritual victory.

**Vijaya Ekadashi** occurs during the Krishna Paksha (Vad) of the month of Phalguna. As the name ‘Vijaya’ suggests, this fast is associated with victory. Ancient scriptures state that Lord Rama observed this fast to seek success before crossing the ocean to Lanka. Devotees observe this to overcome obstacles and achieve success in their endeavors.

**Differences by Context, Version, or Time**

The timing of **agiyaras february 2026 gujarati calendar** dates can vary based on geographical location. The start and end of a Tithi (lunar day) are calculated based on the position of the moon and sun. Because sunrise times differ across the globe, the date of observance might differ by one day between India, the UK, and the USA. It is vital to consult a calendar customized for your specific location.

The strictness of the observance also changes based on personal capacity. Some devotees opt for a ‘Nirjala’ fast (without water), while others consume water and fruits. The Gujarati tradition often includes ‘Farali’ food—dietary items specifically permitted during fasting, such as potatoes, peanuts, and sago (sabudana), distinct from regular grain-based meals.

**Key Features and Elements of the Observance**

The central element of Agiyaras is the prohibition of grains and beans. Wheat, rice, pulses, and corn are strictly avoided. This dietary restriction is based on the belief that these foods absorb negative energies on this specific lunar day and are heavier to digest, which hinders meditation and prayer.

Another key feature is the ‘Parana’ or the time of breaking the fast. The fast must be broken the next day (Dwadashi) within a specific time frame, usually after sunrise but before the Dwadashi tithi ends. Missing this window is considered to reduce the merit of the fast.

Worship rituals (Pujan) involve bathing the deity of Lord Vishnu or Krishna, offering Tulsi leaves (which are very dear to Vishnu), and chanting mantras like ‘Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya’. Reading the specific ‘Vrat Katha’ (story) associated with that month’s Agiyaras is also a mandatory component for many.

**Practical Uses and Applications**

For the individual, observing Agiyaras serves as a powerful tool for self-discipline. It trains the mind to control cravings and hunger, fostering willpower that translates into other areas of life. From a health perspective, giving the digestive system a rest twice a month is advocated by many Ayurveda practitioners for detoxification.

In a family setting, these dates serve as opportunities for collective worship. Gujarati families often prepare special Farali meals that are enjoyed together, reinforcing cultural traditions and culinary heritage. It is a time when the kitchen shifts from routine rotis to dishes made from Rajgira (amaranth) and Singoda (water chestnut) flour.

For the business community and planners, knowing the **agiyaras february 2026 gujarati calendar** is essential for scheduling events. Many traditional families avoid scheduling weddings or heavy feasts on Agiyaras out of respect for the fasting rules of their guests.

**How to Choose the Right Option**

When deciding how to observe Agiyaras in February 2026, consider your health and daily schedule. Beginners should not attempt a waterless fast immediately. It is better to start with a fruit-based diet to maintain energy levels while adhering to the religious rules.

Always verify the date using a reputable Gujarati calendar (Panchang) source. Look for calendars that specify ‘Sud’ (bright) and ‘Vad’ (dark) clearly. If you are confused between two dates listed in different sources, following the tradition of your local temple or family priest (Gor Maharaj) is usually the best course of action.

Avoid the common mistake of consuming prohibited items inadvertently. Many packaged foods contain grain derivatives or non-iodized salt which might not be suitable for strict fasting. Preparing fresh food at home using rock salt (Sendha Namak) is the safest and most traditional approach.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Can I drink coffee or tea during Agiyaras?**  
Yes, most devotees consume tea or coffee, provided it is not accompanied by grain-based biscuits. Some strict observers avoid caffeine, but it is generally accepted in Gujarati tradition.

**Q: What if I accidentally eat grains?**  
If it happens unknowingly, devotees usually ask for forgiveness mentally and continue the fast for the rest of the day. The intention (Bhav) is considered more important than the accidental slip.

**Q: Why are rice and grains prohibited?**  
Religious texts suggest that a demonic entity dwells in grains on Ekadashi. Scientifically, it is believed that atmospheric pressure changes on this lunar day make digestion of grains difficult, leading to bodily discomfort.

**Q: How do I find the Parana time for February 2026?**  
The Parana time is listed in the Panchang for the day following Agiyaras. It typically begins after sunrise on the 12th day (Dwadashi).

**Q: Is Agiyaras different from Pradosh?**  
Yes. Agiyaras is the 11th day dedicated to Vishnu, while Pradosh is the 13th day dedicated to Lord Shiva. They are close in timing but have different rituals.

**Conclusion**

Tracking the **agiyaras february 2026 gujarati calendar** dates allows devotees to align their physical actions with spiritual goals. Whether it is the liberating Jaya Ekadashi or the victorious Vijaya Ekadashi, these days offer a profound opportunity for mental clarity, physical detoxification, and religious merit.

By understanding the nuances of the Gujarati calendar, the specific dietary rules, and the timing of the moon’s phases, you can observe these fasts with confidence and devotion. As February 2026 approaches, mark your calendars early to ensure you are prepared with the necessary Farali ingredients and the right mindset for worship.
