The Tamil calendar, also known as the Tamil Panchangam, is a lunisolar calendar used by Tamil speakers. It is deeply intertwined with Hindu religious practices and astrological predictions. Pournami, meaning ‘full moon’ in Tamil, marks the completion of the waxing phase of the moon and the beginning of its waning phase. This day is considered highly auspicious and is often observed with specific pujas, vratams (fasts), and other religious ceremonies. Knowing the exact Pournami date is essential for adherents to maintain the sanctity and timing of these practices.

The significance of Pournami extends beyond just the full moon. It is believed to be a time when spiritual energy is at its peak, making it an ideal period for meditation, prayer, and seeking divine blessings. Many important festivals and observances are directly linked to the Pournami day, such as Guru Purnima and parts of other major festivals. For those planning to undertake spiritual journeys, perform specific rituals, or simply align their practices with the lunar cycle, accurate calendar information is indispensable.

While Pournami is universally understood as the full moon day, its exact timing and corresponding date can vary slightly depending on the specific Panchangam used and the geographical location for which the calendar is calculated. Different regional Panchangams might have minor variations in the calculation of sunrise, sunset, and tithi (lunar day) timings. Therefore, it is important to refer to a reliable source for the specific Pournami date relevant to your region or the tradition you follow.

Pournami is not a singular event but is determined by the Tithi, which is a specific duration of the lunar day. There are 27 Tithis, and Pournami Tithi is the 15th Tithi. This Tithi begins when the moon reaches 180 degrees of separation from the sun and ends when it reaches 190 degrees. The key is that the Pournami Tithi must be present during the sunrise or at any point during the day for it to be considered the Pournami day. Sometimes, the Pournami Tithi might extend into the next day, or it might begin late in the evening of the previous day, leading to potential confusion if not carefully observed.

The Tamil calendar system is intricate, often incorporating specific asterisms (Nakshatras) and planetary positions to determine auspicious timings. For Pournami, the Nakshatra during the full moon is also considered. For instance, if the full moon occurs when the moon is in the Pushya Nakshatra, it is known as Guru Purnima, a highly significant day dedicated to spiritual gurus. Understanding these nuances helps in appreciating the depth of the calendar system.

When looking at the February 2026 Tamil calendar, the Pournami date is a critical piece of information for many. The precise timing of the Pournami Tithi is calculated based on astronomical observations and mathematical formulas. These calculations ensure that the calendar remains accurate and reflects the celestial movements, allowing individuals to plan their religious and cultural activities with confidence.

The month of February 2026 falls within the Tamil month of Masi. Masi is the eleventh month in the Tamil calendar, typically spanning from mid-February to mid-March. Therefore, the Pournami in February 2026 will occur during the Tamil month of Masi. This alignment is important for those who refer to both the Gregorian and Tamil calendars for their observances.

**Determining the February 2026 Pournami Date**  
Based on standard astronomical calculations for the Tamil Panchangam, the Pournami Tithi in February 2026 is expected to occur on **Saturday, February 7th, 2026**. The Pournami Tithi will commence on the evening of Friday, February 6th, and conclude on the evening of Saturday, February 7th. Therefore, Saturday, February 7th, 2026, will be observed as the primary Pournami day.

The specific timing of the Pournami Tithi on February 7th, 2026, is crucial for observance. The Tithi is expected to be present throughout the day, making it the designated Pournami. It is advisable to consult a local Tamil Panchangam or a reputable online calendar for the exact start and end times of the Pournami Tithi in your specific time zone to perform rituals at the most auspicious moments.

Observing Pournami involves various practices. Many individuals observe a fast (vratam) on this day, which can be partial or complete, depending on personal inclination and tradition. Devotees often visit temples, offer prayers to their chosen deities, and perform special abhishekam (ritual bathing) and alankaram (adornment) for the deities. Chanting mantras and meditating are also common practices to harness the spiritual energy of the full moon.

The day following Pournami is known as Pradosham in some traditions, or simply the day when the moon starts waning. For those observing specific monthly rituals or seeking astrological remedies, the Pournami day is a focal point. It is also a time when many believe that making charitable donations or performing acts of kindness yields significant positive karma.

The influence of the moon on Earth is well-documented, affecting tides and, according to many traditions, human emotions and well-being. In astrological contexts, the full moon is often seen as a time of heightened emotions and clarity, where hidden matters can come to light. This makes Pournami a powerful day for introspection and understanding one’s inner self.

When planning for February 2026, aligning personal schedules with the Tamil calendar’s Pournami date is essential for those who adhere to its traditions. This includes scheduling religious ceremonies, family gatherings related to spiritual events, or personal fasting days. Accurate information prevents the accidental observance of the wrong day, which can be spiritually significant.

For individuals living outside of India, particularly in regions with different time zones, it is imperative to verify the Pournami timing. The start and end times of the Tithi can be affected by the local sunrise and sunset times. Using a Panchangam that is localized or provides global timings can help in accurately observing the Pournami on February 7th, 2026.

The Tamil calendar month of Masi, during which this Pournami falls, is often associated with specific prayers and rituals dedicated to Lord Shiva. Many temples conduct special pujas and homams during Masi month, culminating on Pournami. Therefore, the Pournami in February 2026 is an important event within the broader context of Masi month observances.

Different communities might have slight variations in how they celebrate or observe Pournami. Some might focus more on specific deity worship, while others might emphasize fasting and meditation.
