Ekadashi is the eleventh lunar day, or *Tithi*, of each of the two lunar phases in the Vedic calendar: the waxing phase (Shukla Paksha) and the waning phase (Krishna Paksha). Occurring twice a month, there are typically 24 Ekadashis in a year. This day is particularly dedicated to Lord Vishnu and is observed by many as a day of fasting, prayer, and spiritual introspection to cleanse the body, mind, and soul, and to seek the blessings of the divine.

The observance of Ekadashi is not just about abstaining from food; it is a holistic practice aimed at detaching from worldly desires and focusing on spiritual consciousness. The spiritual merits gained from observing a single Ekadashi fast are believed to be greater than those obtained from performing grand sacrifices or giving extensive charity. It is a cornerstone of devotional practice for many Hindus worldwide.

A key point of distinction in observing Ekadashi lies between two main traditions: Smarta and Vaishnava. This often leads to two different dates for the same Ekadashi in many calendars, which can be a source of confusion for practitioners.

**Smarta Ekadashi** is generally observed by followers of the Smarta tradition, which reveres all major Hindu deities equally. They typically observe Ekadashi on the day when the eleventh Tithi is predominant at sunrise. If the tenth Tithi (Dashami) is still present at sunrise and the eleventh Tithi begins later in the day, Smartas may observe the fast on that day itself.

**Vaishnava Ekadashi**, on the other hand, is followed by Vaishnavas, who are devotees primarily of Lord Vishnu and his avatars like Krishna and Rama. Their rules are stricter. They observe the fast only when the Ekadashi Tithi is completely pure and not touched by the preceding Dashami Tithi at the time of *Arunodaya* (the 96-minute period before sunrise). This often results in Vaishnava Ekadashi being observed a day after the Smarta Ekadashi.

For the month of February 2026, two Ekadashis will be observed. Each has a unique name and associated story that highlights its specific spiritual benefits.

The first Ekadashi in February 2026 falls during the Shukla Paksha (waxing moon phase) and is known as **Jaya Ekadashi**. It is expected to be observed around **Monday, February 9, 2026**. As always, it is crucial to consult a local Panchangam or calendar for the exact Tithi start and end times for your specific location.

Jaya Ekadashi is significant for its power to absolve one of even the gravest sins, such as the sin of killing a Brahmin. It is believed that observing this Vrat with full faith grants liberation from the cycle of birth and death and frees one from ghostly realms or lower forms of existence.

The second Ekadashi of the month occurs during the Krishna Paksha (waning moon phase) and is called **Vijaya Ekadashi**. This Ekadashi is expected to fall around **Tuesday, February 24, 2026**. The name ‘Vijaya’ itself means victory, and this fast is observed to ensure success and victory in all endeavors.

The significance of Vijaya Ekadashi is highlighted in ancient scriptures, where Lord Rama is said to have observed it upon the advice of sages to ensure his victory over the demon king Ravana and to successfully build the bridge across the ocean to Lanka. Therefore, devotees observe this fast to overcome obstacles and achieve success in challenging situations.

The exact date and, more importantly, the timings for Ekadashi can vary based on your geographical location. The start and end times of the Tithi are calculated based on the position of the moon, and sunrise/sunset times are critical for determining the fasting day and the subsequent fast-breaking time (Parana). Most online calendars and apps allow you to set your city to get precise local timings.

It’s important to understand that while the dates provided are accurate for the Indian subcontinent, minor variations can occur for those living in different time zones across Europe, North America, and other parts of the world. Always use a calendar that adjusts for your local time zone to ensure proper observance.

**Key Elements for Observing the February 2026 Calendar Ekadashi Date**

Observing Ekadashi involves more than just knowing the date. The core components are the fast itself and the rituals that accompany it. Understanding these elements is key to reaping the full spiritual benefits.

The most important rule of Ekadashi is abstaining from all grains and beans (legumes). This includes rice, wheat, barley, lentils, chickpeas, and any products made from them. This dietary restriction is considered crucial for the spiritual efficacy of the fast.

The level of fasting can vary based on an individual’s health, age, and spiritual capacity. Some devotees undertake a strict *Nirjala* fast without food or water. Others may consume only water, while many opt for a diet of fruits, nuts, milk products, and specific non-grain foods like buckwheat (kuttu), water chestnut flour (singhara), and tapioca (sabudana).

**Parana: The Sacred Act of Breaking the Fast**

Just as important as the fast is the Parana, the act of breaking it. The fast must be broken on the following day (Dwadashi) after sunrise, but within a specific time window known as the Parana time. Breaking the fast before or after this prescribed time is believed to negate the spiritual benefits of the Vrat. This timing is also location-dependent and must be checked carefully.

The fast is traditionally broken with a small morsel of grain-based food, often something made from rice, to signify the end of the observance.

Ekadashi is an ideal day for intensifying one’s spiritual practices. This includes chanting the holy names of Lord Vishnu, especially the mantra *‘Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya’*. Reading chapters from sacred texts like the Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam is also highly recommended. Many devotees also choose to stay awake through the night (known as *Jagarana*), singing devotional songs and hearing stories about the Lord.

The practical application of the Ekadashi calendar extends beyond individual spiritual practice. Temples and spiritual communities organize special programs, lectures, and kirtans on this day, making it a focal point for collective worship and community bonding.

For personal planning, marking the Ekadashi dates in your calendar helps in preparing mentally and physically for the fast. It allows you to schedule your work and social commitments accordingly and to procure the necessary food items if you plan to follow a specific Ekadashi diet.

When deciding which Ekadashi date to follow—Smarta or Vaishnava—the primary guidance should come from your family tradition or spiritual lineage (Sampradaya). If you follow a specific guru or are part of an institution like ISKCON, you should follow the date prescribed by them, which is typically the Vaishnava Ekadashi.

For those without a specific affiliation, many follow the Vaishnava calendar as its rules are considered more stringent and clearly defined to avoid any overlap with the previous Tithi. The most common mistake beginners make is not paying attention to the local Parana time. Always double-check the window for breaking the fast in your specific city.

**Frequently Asked Questions about Ekadashi**

* **What are the names of the two Ekadashis in February 2026?**  
  The Ekadashi in the bright half of the month (Shukla Paksha) is Jaya Ekadashi, and the one in the dark half (Krishna Paksha) is Vijaya Ekadashi.
* **Can I drink water during an Ekadashi fast?**  
  Yes, for most people, drinking water is permissible. A complete fast without water (Nirjala) is very difficult and is usually undertaken only by those who are physically capable and accustomed to such austerities.
* **Why are grains forbidden on Ekadashi?**  
  According to Puranic texts, all sins take shelter in grains on the day of Ekadashi. Consuming them on this day is believed to be equivalent to consuming sin itself. Scientifically, grains retain a lot of water and can make one feel heavy and lethargic, which hinders the spiritual focus intended for the day.
* **What happens if I accidentally break my fast?**  
  If the fast is broken unintentionally, it is advised to mentally ask for forgiveness from Lord Vishnu and continue with other spiritual activities for the rest of the day. You can then try to observe the next Ekadashi with greater care and attention.
* **Are the Ekadashi dates the same everywhere in the world?**  
  The lunar day (Tithi) is the same, but due to time zone differences, the date on the Gregorian calendar can sometimes differ. For instance, an Ekadashi starting late at night in India might fall on the previous calendar day in North America. This is why using a local calendar is essential.
* **What is the importance of Parana time?**  
  Parana is the prescribed time window on Dwadashi (the 12th day) for breaking the fast. Completing the fast by breaking it within this specific period is considered a critical part of the observance. Breaking it too early or too late can invalidate the Vrat.

In conclusion, understanding the **February 2026 calendar Ekadashi date** is the first step towards participating in a powerful spiritual practice. Both Jaya and Vijaya Ekadashi offer unique blessings, from liberation and purification to victory and success. By paying attention to the correct dates for your tradition, following the fasting rules diligently, and most importantly, observing the correct Parana time for your location, you can fully embrace the spiritual and physical benefits of this sacred Vrat.

Ultimately, observing Ekadashi is an act of devotion and discipline. It is an opportunity to pause from the routine of daily life, purify the body and mind, and strengthen one’s connection with the divine. May your observance be filled with peace, devotion, and spiritual upliftment.
