People search for this information to align their activities with the lunar cycle, participate in religious practices, and understand the cultural significance of Pournami. This article will provide a comprehensive overview of the February 2026 Pournami date, its importance, and related information to help you make informed decisions.

Pournami, also known as Purnima, is the lunar phase when the moon appears fully illuminated from Earth’s perspective. This occurs when the Earth is positioned directly between the Sun and the Moon. The full moon has been observed and celebrated across various cultures throughout history, often associated with heightened energy and spiritual significance.

Pournami holds immense importance in Hinduism. Many devotees observe fasts, perform special pujas, and engage in charitable activities on this day.

Pournami differs from other lunar phases like Amavasya (new moon) and Ekadashi (the eleventh lunar day). While Amavasya is often associated with ancestral rites, and Ekadashi with fasting and devotion to Lord Vishnu, Pournami is primarily linked to the worship of the moon and various deities, and is considered highly auspicious for initiating new ventures.

For example, some regions might emphasize fasting, while others focus on elaborate temple rituals or community gatherings. The specific mantras and prayers recited can also differ.
