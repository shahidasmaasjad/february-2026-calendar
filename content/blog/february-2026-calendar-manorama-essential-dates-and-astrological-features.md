Searching for this calendar often indicates a need to align personal schedules with cultural and astrological significance. Whether you are looking for specific auspicious times (Muhoorthams), checking the position of the stars (Nakshatra), or simply planning around public holidays, understanding how to read this calendar is essential. This guide explores the structure, features, and practical applications of the Manorama calendar for February 2026.

### Overview of the Manorama Calendar System

The Manorama calendar is distinct because of its dual nature. While it prominently displays the standard Gregorian dates (February 1st to 28th, 2026), it simultaneously tracks the Malayalam calendar dates. In February 2026, the calendar will reflect the transition between the Malayalam months of *Makaram* and *Kumbham*. This duality is crucial for individuals who schedule their lives according to the solar calendar system followed in Kerala.

Historically, the Manorama almanac has been trusted for its accuracy in astronomical calculations. It provides detailed data regarding sunrise and sunset times, which vary slightly depending on the location but are standardized for Kerala in the print edition. The calendar acts as a daily guide, offering information that ranges from government holidays to specific astrological constraints like Rahu Kalam and Gulika Kalam.

The relevance of this calendar extends beyond simple date-checking. It is a comprehensive repository of cultural data. For the month of February 2026, users will look to this calendar to identify key festivals, bank holidays, and the specific days prohibited for certain activities. It serves as a bridge between modern scheduling needs and traditional lifestyle practices.

### Core Variations and Formats

The **february 2026 calendar manorama** is available in several formats, each catering to different user needs. The most traditional form is the wall calendar, often found in Malayali households. This version uses color-coding—typically red for Sundays and holidays, and black for regular working days—to make visual scanning easy. The text is usually in Malayalam, though English subtitles are common in international editions.

In the digital age, the mobile application and online PDF versions have gained immense popularity. These digital variations often allow users to toggle between English and Malayalam languages. They also provide interactive features, such as setting reminders for specific Tithis or Nakshatras, which is not possible with the static print version. The digital format is particularly useful for the diaspora living in time zones different from India.

Another variation is the desktop or table planner. This format focuses more on business utility, providing space for notes while still retaining the essential astrological data at the bottom of each date block. While less detailed than the wall calendar or the almanac (Panchangam) book, it strikes a balance for professional environments.

### Differences in Context and Usage

The interpretation of the calendar changes based on the user’s location and intent. For a user in Kerala, the sunrise times and holiday listings in the February 2026 edition are directly applicable. However, for Malayalis living in the United States or Europe, the printed sunrise times must be adjusted. The Manorama digital apps often solve this by allowing location-based customization to ensure accuracy for prayer times and rituals.

Context also matters regarding the version of the calendar being used. The ‘Travancore’ and ‘Malabar’ regions sometimes have slight variations in festival observances or local holidays. The Manorama calendar generally standardizes this but may note regional exceptions. Furthermore, the year 2026 is not a leap year, meaning February will have exactly 28 days, a standard structure that simplifies monthly planning compared to leap years.

### Key Features of the February 2026 Edition

**Nakshatra (Stars):** One of the most critical elements of the calendar is the daily Nakshatra. For February 2026, the calendar will list the ruling star for each day, which changes at a specific time. This is vital for birthday celebrations (Pirannal) which are calculated based on the star rather than the English date.

**Tithi (Lunar Day):** The calendar indicates the phase of the moon (Waxing or Waning). This information is essential for determining dates for fasting (Vratam) and other rituals like Pradosham or Ekadashi. The precise ending time of each Tithi is usually noted in the calendar’s fine print.

**Rahu Kalam and Gulika Kalam:** These are fixed time windows calculated based on sunrise and sunset. Rahu Kalam is generally considered inauspicious for starting new ventures, while Gulika Kalam is often associated with repetitive events. The Manorama calendar provides these timings daily, helping users avoid unfavorable windows.

**Visheshadivasangal (Special Days):** The calendar highlights major festivals and observances. In February, this often includes events like Maha Shivaratri (depending on the lunar cycle for that specific year) or church festivals. The Manorama edition is known for its exhaustive list of religious events across Hindu, Christian, and Islamic faiths.

### Practical Uses and Applications

**Wedding Planning:** February is often a preferred month for weddings in Kerala due to the relatively pleasant weather before the summer heat peaks. Families use the **february 2026 calendar manorama** to find ‘Muhoorthams’—auspicious time slots for marriage ceremonies. The calendar explicitly marks these dates, allowing families to book venues and arrangements well in advance.

**Agricultural Activities:** Traditional farmers still rely on the Malayalam dates (Makaram and Kumbham) found in the calendar for planting and harvesting cycles. The transition of the sun and the specific Njattuvela (sun’s position in a star) influences agricultural decisions, and this data is readily available in the almanac.

**Construction and Housewarming:** For those planning to start the construction of a house or conduct a housewarming (Palukachal), the calendar helps identify suitable dates. Vastu-compliant dates are often highlighted, ensuring that homeowners can align their ceremonies with traditional beliefs.

**Travel and Business:** On a secular level, the calendar is used to track bank holidays and government closures. Businesses use it to plan staffing and operational hours. The clear distinction between ‘red’ dates (holidays) and regular days helps in effective resource management.

### How to Choose the Right Version

When selecting the right version of the calendar for February 2026, consider your primary mode of access. If you need a quick reference for the kitchen or living room that the whole family can see, the large-print wall calendar is the best choice. It requires no technology and is always ‘on.’

For professionals or students who are constantly on the move, the mobile app or a downloaded PDF is superior. These formats often allow for search functionality, making it easier to find specific festivals or dates without manually scanning the grid. Additionally, ensure you are accessing the official Manorama release to guarantee the accuracy of the astrological data, as many imitators exist.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**What Malayalam months fall in February 2026?**  
February 2026 typically spans the end of the Malayalam month *Makaram* and the beginning of *Kumbham*. The transition usually occurs around the middle of the month, often on February 13th or 14th.

**Does the Manorama calendar list bank holidays?**  
Yes, the calendar clearly marks all Kerala state government holidays and bank holidays. These are usually indicated in red ink to distinguish them from regular working days.

**Can I use the Kerala print calendar for dates in the USA?**  
While the dates and Nakshatras remain the same, the timings for sunrise, sunset, Rahu Kalam, and the exact ending times of Tithis will differ due to the time zone and longitude. It is best to use a location-adjusted digital version for precise timings outside India.

**How do I find the Nakshatra for a specific day?**  
In the Manorama calendar, the Nakshatra is listed in the date block, usually in Malayalam script. It often includes the time when the star changes. If a day has two stars, both will be listed with their respective end times.

**Is February 2026 a leap year?**
